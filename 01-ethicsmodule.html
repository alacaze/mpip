<section>
<section id="introduction" class="title-slide slide level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>

</section>
<section id="key-concepts" class="slide level2">
<h2>Key concepts</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Healthcare decisions are ethical decisions</li>
<li>Patient-centred care is good care. The justification for patient-centred care is ethical.</li>
<li>We employ two psychological systems for making decisions. The quick, System 1, and the comprehensive, System 2.</li>
<li>You should take a structured approach to making ethical decisions (much like you take a structured approach to clinical decisions)</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="ethics-and-decisions" class="slide level2">
<h2>Ethics and decisions</h2>
<p>Most, if not all, professional decisions in pharmacy have an ethical component.</p>
<p>One way to see this is to reflect on what people <em>value</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="people-value-health" class="slide level2">
<h2>People value health</h2>
<p>People of very different ages, backgrounds and capacity <em>value</em> good health.</p>
<p>This is despite the fact that people often have very different values and very different levels of health.</p>
<p class="question">
People value good health—however they perceive “good health”.
</p>
</section>
<section id="personal-values-influence-health-choices" class="slide level2">
<h2>Personal values influence health choices</h2>
<p>The <em>choices</em> people make with regard to their health is influenced by a wide range of personal values.</p>
<p>People differ greatly in their willingness to accept certain types of treatment, kinds of adverse effects, and levels of risk (among many other things)</p>
<p class="question">
Personal values inform health choices, and these vary greatly
</p>
</section>
<section id="ethics-decisions-and-patient-centred-care" class="slide level2">
<h2>Ethics, decisions and patient-centred care</h2>
<p>Put these two together—people value health, and personal values inform health choices—and you get two important consequences.</p>
<p class="fragment">
You are here to help people about something that is very important to them. Part of being a health professional is accepting responsibility for a person’s health in terms of the care you provide.
</p>
<p class="fragment">
You need to provide that care in way that is consistent with that person’s values. That is, you need to provide “patient-centred care”
</p>
<!-- <p class="question incremental">Key points: healthcare decisions are ethical decisions and you provide patient-centred care because it is the ethically right thing to do.</p>  -->
</section>
<section id="healthcare-decisions-are-ethical-decisions" class="slide level2">
<h2>Healthcare decisions are ethical decisions</h2>
<p>Appreciating the role you are playing as a healthcare professional is important.</p>
<p>Many of the things you do as a pharmacist become routine—checking for allergies, consulting with a consumer regarding an antibiotic, dispensing emergency contraception, identifying a potential drug interaction, etc.</p>
<p class="question">
When you perform these tasks you make many decisions—given the context you are in, all of these decisions have an ethical component.
</p>
</section>
<section id="patient-centred-care" class="slide level2">
<h2>Patient-centred care</h2>
<p>Providing patient-centred care is:</p>
<p class="question">
Providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions <span class="citation" data-cites="national2001Crossing">(Institute of Medicine 2001)</span>
</p>
<p class="fragment">
Patient-centred care is good care. It serves as a reminder of what the point of healthcare is. It is important because time pressures, financial pressures and the complexity of health care can make good decisions difficult to make.
</p>
</section>
<section id="when-is-care-not-patient-centred" class="slide level2">
<h2>When is care not patient-centred</h2>
<p>Pharmacists fail to achieve the goal of patient-centred care when they:</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Focus on a list of medicines rather than the patient taking those medicines</li>
<li class="fragment">Counsel patients rather than consult with them</li>
<li class="fragment">Fail to explore the patient’s reasons and expectations in relation to their medicines</li>
</ul>

<h1>Decisions and heuristics</h1>

</section>
<section id="why-isnt-the-ethical-dimension-of-our-decisions-more-obvious" class="slide level2">
<h2>Why isn’t the ethical dimension of our decisions more obvious?</h2>
<p>Sure there are some <em>big</em> ethical questions—suicide, abortion, drug addiction,…—and these can take time to think through.</p>
<p>But for most of our day-to-day decisions we don’t seem to spend much time thinking about ethics.</p>
</section>
<section id="section" class="slide level2">
<h2></h2>
<p class="question">
Ethical decisions are like any other decision, they are informed by our values and our experiences.
</p>
<p class="fragment">
We develop quite sophisticated sets of heuristics (rules of thumb) to handle the most common scenarios quickly and easily
</p>
<p class="fragment">
Mostly these heuristics work very well, but sometimes they lead us astray—it is important to recognise the heuristics you use and to reflect on the values that underpin them
</p>
</section>
<section id="example" class="slide level2">
<h2>Example</h2>
<div style="font-size: 80%">
<p>Let’s say that these two people present to your community pharmacy with similar symptoms and request a pseudoephedrine-containing cold and flu product.</p>
<p><img data-src="figtab/Mug.jpg" alt="Mug shot" /> <img data-src="figtab/BW.jpg" alt="Betty" /></p>
<p class="fragment">
Chances are you are likely to treat their request differently, and to the extent that you do so it will be informed by a heuristic (which in turn is informed by explicit and implicit value judgements)
</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="decisions-and-heuristics-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Decisions and heuristics</h2>
<p>Daniel Kahneman is a psychologist who has done a lot of work on how people make decisions <span class="citation" data-cites="kahneman2011">(Kahneman 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>His work identifies two systems</p>
<p class="question">
<strong>System 1</strong> operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control
</p>
<p class="question">
<strong>System 2</strong> allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations.
</p>
<p>Recognising these systems is helpful for thinking about ethical decisions in pharmacy</p>
</section>
<section id="day-to-day-decisions" class="slide level2">
<h2>Day-to-day decisions</h2>
<p>There are some decisions that we make a lot.</p>
<ul>
<li>When do you sell pseudoephedrine?</li>
<li>Which patients do you prioritise on the ward?</li>
<li>How much discussion do you have with a consumer purchasing OTC salbutamol?</li>
<li>Do you sell sharps kits?</li>
<li>Do you provide emergency supply when the patient’s doctor can’t be contacted</li>
</ul>
<p>Most pharmacists will rely on <em>System 1</em> for these types of decisions.</p>
</section>
<section id="reflecting-on-day-to-day-decisions" class="slide level2">
<h2>Reflecting on day-to-day decisions</h2>
<p>When starting out, either as an intern or coming to a new area of practice, you often need to think through the day-to-day decisions of an area more deliberately—here you use <em>System 2</em>.</p>
<p>There is good and bad about this.</p>
<p class="question incremental">
You take longer to make what is seen as a routine decision
</p>
<p class="question incremental">
But you think that decision through more carefully
</p>
</section>
<section id="reflecting-on-day-to-day-decisions-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Reflecting on day-to-day decisions</h2>
<p>Sometime after it has shifted to a routine decision, it is important to reflect on whether you are making the <em>right</em> decision</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you achieving what you set out to achieve?</li>
<li>Are there any bad consequences to the approach you are taking?—maybe your approach works for 90% of cases, but turns out spectacularly wrong in the other 10%</li>
<li>Can you justify your decision?</li>
<li>Is your decision in line with professional standards?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="difficult-decisions" class="slide level2">
<h2>Difficult decisions</h2>
<p>When matters arise that are not routine you need to engage <em>System 2</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A customer on high doses of morphine inquires about assisted-euthanasia.</li>
<li>A regular customer appears to be escalating their benzodiazepine use beyond what is prescribed.</li>
</ul>
<p>These decisions often need some thinking and a careful consideration of the context.</p>
</section>
<section id="take-home-point" class="slide level2">
<h2>Take home point</h2>
<p class="question">
You need a framework for thinking through ethical decisions
</p>
<p>This framework is important to both day-to-day decisions and more difficult decisions.</p>
<p>Most day-to-day decisions were once difficult decisions.</p>
<p>And once something has become a routine day-to-day decision it can be even more important to review it on occasion.</p>
<p class="question">
You make routine decisions routinely—if you are getting it wrong the harms may accumulate
</p>
</section></section>

<section id="a-model-for-ethical-decision-making" class="title-slide slide level1">
<h1>A model for ethical decision making</h1>

</section>
<section id="why-do-i-need-a-model-for-ethical-decision-making" class="slide level2">
<h2>Why do I need a model for ethical decision-making?</h2>
<p>The downside of both the <em>principles of bioethics</em> and the codes of conduct/ethics are that they are not very explicit in regards to how to go about making ethical decisions.</p>
<p>The model we will focus on (and use in the tutorial) outlines the process that is expected of you in your intern year.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-model-for-ethical-decision-making-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>A model for ethical decision-making</h2>
<div style="font-size: 70%">
<ol type="1">
<li>Identify the problem and possible consequences of the problem
<ul>
<li>What facts are available?</li>
<li>What facts are still required?</li>
<li>What is the ethical problem? (Is there a conflict between two or more guiding principles?)</li>
<li>What harms are you concerned about? Who is affected?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Identify relevant law and professional standards that apply to the case
<ul>
<li>What are your legal responsibilities?</li>
<li>What are your professional responsibilities?</li>
<li>How can you fulfil your legal and professional responsibilities in a way that brings about the best outcome in the situation?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Identify the available options for resolving the problem and the reasons for or against each one</li>
<li>Formulate a plan of action to resolve the problem
<ul>
<li>What do you need to put in place to improve the chances of a successful outcome?</li>
<li>How will you mitigate any risks you have identified?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
</section>
<section id="putting-the-model-to-work" class="slide level2">
<h2>Putting the model to work</h2>
<div style="font-size: 80%">
<p>Most of the steps in this framework are self-explanatory. You will get an opportunity to put the model to work in the tutorial.</p>
<p>Some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Thinking through who might be harmed (and how they could be harmed) is often a good place to start with an ethical challenge.</li>
<li class="fragment">It is important to think an issue through from multiple perspectives: the patient, the carer, the prescriber, the nurse and your perspective</li>
<li class="fragment">If we have a clinical question we don’t hesitate to search the available literature for an answer—searching the literature for an ethical problem can be just as helpful</li>
<li class="fragment">Sometimes in the face of a difficult decision it can be tempting to do nothing. Remember: doing nothing is just as much a decision any other action—can you justify your inaction?</li>
</ul>
